## GIF2Video Datasets

[Issue]: GIF-Moments dataset is too large (83G) to download from our server.   
Suggestions are welcome on where I can host the dataset.

This repo contains code to prepare two datasets: `GIF-Faces` and `GIF-Moments`.

1. download tar files under `./download/` folder    
2. follow instructions in `./gif_faces/` and `./gif_moments/`
